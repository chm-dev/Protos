/*
Tap and Hold Manager v1.1

Callback				A function object to call when a tap occurs
						The function will be passed the number of taps that occurred.
						The function will also be passed the event that occurred
							-1 = Tap
							1 = (Hold) Press
							0 = (Hold) Release
							
tapTime (optional)		The amount of time to wait before deciding if an event is a tap or hold
						Defaults to 200ms
						
prefixes (optional)		The prefixes to apply to the hotkey
						Defaults to $ (Do not trigger hotkey if you send that key)
