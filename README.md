This is my private workflow enhancer in AHK which i use all the time.

Makes a lot of things easier.
* Capslock as new modifier
* Manipulate windows (min, max, restore, always on top) with caps+mouse wheel / click actions (caps + mw scroll down = minimize current window)
* Resize windows (ctrl + shift + mouse wheel)
* Global and app specific (spotify) volume control
* RAlt to drag-move any window 
* Caps + z to center and resize active window on current screen
* Pin any active window for easy restore (caps + f1 - f12, caps + 1 - 0)
* Game / Focus mode toggle (kill explorer.exe) caps + backspace
* Few helpful hotstrings 
* Many more experimental and accesibility features ....
